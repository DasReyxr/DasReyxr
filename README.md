# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a future electronics engineer, also a tech passionate about **HDL Design, Embedded Systems and coding**. 
My philospophy is to focus on **scalability and optimization**. I enjoy working with different microcontrollers like **AVRs, ARM and PIC** (with a strong preference for ARM), **VHDL**, and I enjoy designing efficient **digital systems using VHDL**.


## What I Do
- **Embedded Systems**: Writing clean, optimized codes for a wide range of microcontrollers.
- **HDL / FPGA Design**: Developing both sequential and combinational circuits with clear, modular architectures.  
- **Python Development**: Integrating APIs and libraries for automation in different applications e.g. Creating Playlist on Spotify based on genres, solving math problems using `numpy` and `sympy`.
- **Networks and Databases**: Setting up NAS Servers to host SQL databases for personal and professional projects.



## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Assembly (PIC, ARM, AVR), Embedded C, C, C++, Python
- **Professional Tools**: Figma, GitHub, LaTeX
